# rpkg
Installing required packages to prepare the R working environment is always painful. To reduce future pain, I created this R package `rkpg`. Installing `rpkg` should install R packages I commonly use.

This package would be useful for me (and other bioinformaticians / computational biologists) whenever I start working on a new cluster or I reinstall my operating system.

## How to install
devtools::install_github("alorchhota/rpkg")
